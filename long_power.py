'''Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is:  (c++ int) or  (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.
'''



# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a= int(input())
b= int(input())
c= int(input())
d= int(input())
print(pow(a,b)+pow(c,d))
